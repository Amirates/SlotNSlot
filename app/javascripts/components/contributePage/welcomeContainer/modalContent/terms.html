The User therefore understands that there is no assurance that, even if the SlotNSlot Project is partially or fully developed and launched, the User will receive any benefits through the SLOT held by him.<br></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&#9642; Risk associated with other applications &#8203;: The User understands and accepts that the SlotNSlot Project may give rise to other, alternative projects, promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which SLOT will have no intrinsic value. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&#9642; Risk of loss of private key &#8203;: SLOT can only be accessed by using an Ethereum wallet with a combination of User&rsquo;s account information (address), private key and password. The private key is encrypted with a password. The User understands and accepts that if his private key file or password respectively got lost or stolen, the obtained SLOT associated with the User&#39;s account (address) or password will be unrecoverable and will be permanently lost. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&#9642; Risk of theft &#8203;: The User understands and accepts that the Smart Contract System concept, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain) may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals that could result in theft or loss of SLOT and/or ETH, impacting the ability to develop the SlotNSlot Project. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&#9642; Risk of Ethereum mining attacks &#8203;: The User understands and accepts that, as with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Smart Contract System is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, &ldquo;selfish-mining&rdquo; attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Smart Contract System, expected proper execution and sequencing of SLOT transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>&#9642; Risk of governance attacks and failure: &#8203;The User understands and accepts that the SlotNSlot Network may use an in-built decentralized governance system (&ldquo;Governance System&rdquo;). For these reasons, it is possible that the Governance System adopts proposals that have an adverse effect on the useful functioning of the SlotNSlot Platform and/or the value of SLOT, if any. If the Governance System is attacked, or becomes controlled either directly or indirectly by some party who makes unwise decisions</span><span>, or the community generally makes unwise decisions,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the value of SLOT, if any, held by the User might be greatly reduced or even permanently lost. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&#9642; Risk of incompatible Wallet service: &#8203;The User understands and accepts, that the wallet or wallet service provider used for the Contribution, has to be technically compatible with the SLOT.
